    <h1>Hallo</h1>
    <p id='p1'>So all of this started when I stumbled upon a site that was like "OH LOOK AT THIS COOL REAL TIME CLOCK WE HAVE", and i was like "Huh, i bet i can make that". i made a clock (the purple button) that updates in real time <i>using complex calculations and<strong> definetly not harvesting your IP Address and knowing your time zone.</strong></i>
        And then i saw another site that was like "OH LOOK AT THIS COOL STOP WATCH", and guess what? i thought 'huh, i bet i can make that', and now we're here. Most of this is just an excuse to try out github hosting anyways so who cares   </p>
